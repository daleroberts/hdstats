# hdstats

A library of multivariate and high-dimensional statistics algorithms.

The mission of this library is to provide algorithms for multivariate data where: (1) the dimensionality *p* is relatively large (with respect to the sample size *n*), (2) there might be missing data, (3) the data might be spatially or temporally stacked and can we use this knowledge to accelerate or enhance the algorithm. 

### Assumptions

We assume that the data stack dimensions are ordered so that the spatial dimensions are first (*y*,*x*), followed by the spectral dimension of size *p*, finishing with the temporal dimension. Algorithms reduce in the last dimension (typically, the temporal dimension).
