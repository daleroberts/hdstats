# hdstats

A library of multivariate and high-dimensional statistics algorithms.

The mission of this library is to provide algorithms for (real world) multivariate data where: (1) the dimension is relatively large (with respect to the sample size), (2) there might be missing data, (3) the data might be spatially or temporally stacked. This library is aimed to completement what is available in numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and scikit-image.
